#Django Candle e-Commerce site for UK company 0&X.
#Django project submission for final Full Stack Framework for Diploma in Software-Engineering with Code Institute(CI).

#Introduction

For my final project I decided to create a live website for an actual business idea that I decided to start. Born from a natural like for candles, I decided to start a candle making business and thought this would be an ideal project idea as it evidently meant e-commerce functionality using the Django Framework. My business is actually called 0&X Candles (Naught and cross) and this project will be used to launch the business and 'go live' after the assessment process has been completed.

The site offers prospective customers everything listed within the requirements of this final project for the course. As a brief hight level overview the project incorporates some of the following features:

- Django 3.0
- HTML5, CSS3, JS and Python
- CSS Grid and Bootstrap 4
- Postrgres 
- Stripe for payments
- Integration of Snipcart - a third party 'shopping cart'
- Integration of SendInBlue - A third-party email/marketing platform
- User authenticated membership section & option reliant on Django User Authentication
- Deployment on PythonAnywhere(https://peggy535.pythonanywhere.com/) (The domain of the site will be changed subsequently after review and assessment)

##Django 3.0 and the projects reuseable apps.

For this project Django 3.0 was used. I commenced this before the CI change of learning materials and changed to this version of the course/project towards the end of May. Thanks to CI for informing me of this, the new material is brilliant and was most welcomed!
